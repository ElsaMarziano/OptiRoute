OptiRoute

This simple project allows the user to enter a depart point and several locations in the same city, and calculate the shortest path the goes through all locations with the help of a BFS algorithm.
Libraries used: google-maps-react-markers, react-google-autocomplete.

Ideas for future development:
- Allow user to choose between walking, driving, bike and transit (as of now, only walking is available)
- Suggest places to see near the path (costs money as of now)
- Make the interface responsive to phone users
- Allow user to choose a finish point and calculate path accordingly (doable with google API)
